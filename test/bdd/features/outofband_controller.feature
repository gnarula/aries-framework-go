    Given "Alice" constructs an out-of-band request with no attachments (controller)
    When "Alice" sends the request to "Bob" through an out-of-band channel (controller)
    And "Bob" accepts the request and connects with "Alice" (controller)
    Then "Alice" and "Bob" have a connection (controller)
